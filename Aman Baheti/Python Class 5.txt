PYTHON 3rd ASSINGNMENT
1. Hint:
-> Make a use of Time Module and for Loop
-> Output Should be :
Loading.
Loading..
Loading...
Loading....
Loading.....
Here it shows you 5 output but you have to print only "Loading....." in animated
form.

import time
print("Loading",end="")
for i in range(0,5,1):
    print(".",end="")
    time.sleep(1)


2. Difference between Return and Yield ?

The yield statement suspends the function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, 
but retains enough state to enable the function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, 
the function continues the execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code
to produce a series of values over time rather them computing them all at once and sending them back like a list.

def simpleGeneratorFun():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
for value in simpleGeneratorFun():
    print(value)
The output of this code will be:

1
2
3

return sends a specified value back to its caller.


3. Make digital Clock and run it for 5 sec.
Output:
16:39:08
:09
:10
:11
:12

import time
from time import strftime
i=0
while i<6:
    print (strftime("%H:%M:%S"), end="", flush=True)
    print("\r", end="", flush=True)
    time.sleep(1)
    i+=1


4. Add anything in tuple.. example: (1,2,3,4) -> new tuple (1,2,3,4,5)

tuplex=(1,2,3,4)
tuplex=tuplex + (5,)
print(tuplex)

5. WhatsApp texting using webbrowser Lib.

import webbrowser
import time
import pyautogui as gui

interval  = 60
position = 664,310
 
numbers={918955503052,919928829271}

msg="Hi"

for i in numbers:
    url='https://wa.me/{}?text={}'.format(i,msg)
    
    webbrowser.open(url)
    time.sleep(15)
    gui.click(position)
    time.sleep(5)
    gui.click(671,399)
    time.sleep(30)
    gui.press('enter')
    time.sleep(interval)
